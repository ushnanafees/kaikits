<h2 class="heading"> POSITIVE BEHAVIOURS WRAPPED IN A CONVENIENT KIT </h2>
<div class="about-para"> 

<p> Did you know that for every second, minute, hour that your child is at
    play or away from you they can be exposed to many illnesses such as
    the common cold and flu or more severe Hand, Foot and Mouth
    Disease?</p>

<p> Did you also know that many of these illnesses could be reduced if
    children were encouraged to protect themselves with proper health
    practices at all times?</p>    

<p> Kai Kit for Kids was born out of the need to encourage and empower
    children to be personally involved with protecting their own health.

    encourage positive behaviours that will last to adulthood.</p>

                <h3>I'm <span class="text-primary">Kailee, a 9 year old girl</span> </h3>
                <p> who loves all things unicorn and emojis.
                        I decided to start Kai Kit for Kids because I realized that sometimes
                        when children are at school, we may have messy situations and may
                        be too frightened or just do not know what to do.</p>     
                    <p> When my mommy gave me a “just in case Kit” it was very helpful for
                        times when I needed things such as hand soap or wipes. She even
                        included a sanitary napkin and started teaching me about how to use
                        this.</p>
                        
                    <p> My friends were surprised that I had a sanitary napkin and asked me
                        about this, so I told them that some little girls may start their periods
                        at an early age and we all needed to be prepared. My friends were
                        curious and excited and wanted to have their own kit and this is when
                        I decided that I wanted to create a kit to help all children to be clean
                        and healthy at all times.</p>
                    <p> So, Imagine that you are at school and you have a messy situation.
                        You can always reach into your Kai Kit for one of the many things that
                        will help you be be clean and healthy because you just never know
                        when stuff will happen.</p>
